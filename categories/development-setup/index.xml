&lt;p&gt;When transitioning to a new development machine, especially one intended to serve as both a local workstation and a remote development server, the setup process requires careful planning. This article documents the complete configuration of a Mac mini M4 (24GB) as a full-featured development environment, focusing on remote accessibility, containerized services, and productivity automation through n8n.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is clear: create a reliable, remotely accessible development hub that supports Go-based backend projects, database management, and workflow automation—all while maintaining clean separation between development tools and system configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
