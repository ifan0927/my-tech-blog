The main challenge was architecting the complete CRUD operations for lease creation, modification, and termination, with particular attention to the integration between lease management and the accounting system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lease-creation-beyond-simple-database-insertion"&gt;Lease Creation: Beyond Simple Database Insertion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a lease involves much more than just inserting a record into the &lt;code&gt;leases&lt;/code&gt; table. The process requires careful orchestration of multiple operations:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Simplifying User Permission Management: A Practical Database Design Approach</title><link>https://ifan0927.github.io/my-tech-blog/posts/2025_11_19_note/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:27:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ifan0927.github.io/my-tech-blog/posts/2025_11_19_note/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building a property management system, one of the first architectural decisions involves user permission management. While it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with its elaborate role hierarchies and permission matrices, sometimes a simpler approach proves more effective. This article explores how I designed a straightforward yet flexible permission system using MySQL and golang-migrate CLI, focusing on pragmatic solutions over theoretical completeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early-stage applications, especially side projects or MVPs, over-engineered permission systems often create more problems than they solve:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
