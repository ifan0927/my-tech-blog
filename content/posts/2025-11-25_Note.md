Today's focus was on establishing an automated n8n workflow to streamline the daily note generation process for Hugo blog posts. The goal was to eliminate manual steps in transforming raw development notes into polished blog content using AI assistance.

## Problem Statement

The current workflow involves several manual steps that create friction in the content creation process:

1. Daily notes require manual formatting and editing after AI processing
2. Hugo post creation involves repetitive file structure setup
3. GitHub deployment requires manual commits and pushes

The solution involves creating an n8n automation that takes raw daily notes, processes them through Claude AI, and automatically creates properly formatted Hugo posts with GitHub integration.

## Docker Configuration for n8n

Set up n8n with Docker to enable local file access through volume mapping:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    volumes:
      - ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n
      - /Users/cheni-fan/n8n:/files
    environment:
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=password
```

The key aspect is the volume mapping `/Users/cheni-fan/n8n:/files` which allows the n8n Read File node to access local development notes. A Code node generates the current date to ensure the correct daily note file is retrieved.

## Content Processing Workflow

After retrieving the raw note content, the workflow processes it through Anthropic's Claude API, followed by a Code node that handles content formatting and metadata generation:

```javascript
// Get input data
const inputData = $input.item.json;
let content = inputData.content[0].text;

// 1. Remove  tags
content = content.replace(/<\/?markdown_output>/g, '');

// 2. Convert 
 strings to actual line breaks
content = content.replace(/\
/g, '
');

// 3. Clean whitespace
content = content.trim();

// 4. Extract information from frontmatter for filename generation
const dateMatch = content.match(/date:\s*"?(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})/);
const titleMatch = content.match(/title:\s*"([^"]+)"/);

// 5. Generate filename (slug)
let fileName = '';
if (dateMatch && titleMatch) {
  const date = dateMatch[1];
  fileName = `${date}_Note.md`;
} else {
  // Fallback: use timestamp
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
  fileName = `${timestamp}-post.md`;
}

// 6. Set file path
const filePath = `content/posts/${fileName}`;

// 7. Prepare commit message
const commitMessage = titleMatch 
  ? `Add post: ${titleMatch[1]}` 
  : `Add new post: ${fileName}`;

// 8. Output for GitHub node
return {
  json: {
    fileContent: content,
    filePath: filePath,
    commitMessage: commitMessage,
    fileName: fileName
  }
};
```

## GitHub Integration

The final step uses n8n's GitHub node to automatically:
- Create the formatted markdown file in the correct Hugo directory structure
- Generate appropriate commit messages based on the post title
- Push changes to the repository

This automation eliminates the manual steps of file creation, formatting, and deployment, creating a seamless pipeline from raw development notes to published blog content.

## Next Steps

The workflow successfully automates the content generation pipeline, but potential enhancements could include:
- Error handling for API failures
- Content validation before publishing
- Integration with Hugo's development server for preview generation
- Automated social media sharing upon successful deployment
